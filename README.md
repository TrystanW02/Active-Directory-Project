# Project Overview

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to get familiar with Windows Active Directory. This project shows how to setup AD and add the different functionalities to it (Domain Controller, DHCP, etc.), as well as adding users to the domain using different means (manual addition or Powershell scripting). This project starts off basic, with the intention of adding more on to it in the future and add additional security functionality.

# Getting Started

## Install and provision each OS needed for the project
1. This step involves going and installing each of the necessary machines, as well as provision them according to the [Virtual Box VMs](#virtual-box-vms) section.
   - Windows Server 2022: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2022
   - Ubuntu Server 24.04.2: https://ubuntu.com/download/server
   - Windows 10: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10
   - Kali Linux: https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines

<br>

2. After each machine is installed and provisioned, make sure to connect all of the machines to the NAT network that you created.

# Project Highlights

<br>

> :memo: This section is meant to show off what this project is capable of! Any new additions to this original project will be shown in this section!

<br>

## Adding New Organizational Units and Users via PowerShell Scripting

<br>

> :bulb: The following images show how to add organizational units and users through powershell scripting. All of the original files are located [here](https://github.com/TrystanW02/Active-Directory-Project/tree/main/Powershell_Scripts/Create_OUs_%26_Users)!

 <br>
 
### *Purpose*

The purpose of this addition is to have the ability to quickly provision new user accounts, without the need of having to go manually add every user in an organization to their respective unit. The goal is to eventually consolidate all of the code into 1 single script, and to eventually add GPO for each unit! Each of the organizational units is meant to have different levels of access to the organizations resources.

<br>

### Names for each of the accounts

Each of the scripts need a ".txt" file that has the names of the employees in the unit. Each one of these text files has 5 randomly generated names to be added to the units. Below is an example of what each text file looks like, specifically the "`Accounting_Names.txt`":
